# What is Computer Science?
Computer science is the study of what makes a computer work. From my perspective, it's a nearly interchangeable term with a 
programming class. It's difficult to say at this point, but I suppose the main difference between a compsci class and a 
programming class would be that the former is more general. We're using Python for the class, which is supposedly one of the
easiest languages to learn. I've used a couple languages in past classes, and while I didn't really excel at any of them, I 
found myself understanding the basic structure of programming with each new language, despite the completely different syntaxes.
The same thing can be done in different languages with very different script.This overarching relation betwen all coding 
languages is what I perceive as Computer Science.
