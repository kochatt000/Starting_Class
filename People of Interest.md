# Ada Lovelace
Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first programmer, despite living from 1815-1852, before digital computers were 
invented. She grew up being privately tutored in mathematics, unusual for a woman at the time. Her contribution to the study 
stems from her instructions regarding the operation of the Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer. The sequence of steps 
found in her notes closely reflects modern programming. She was also seen as something of a prophet for the digital computer, 
as she predicted the possibility of computers manipulating symbols and scientific data, meaning that computers could remain 
useful outside of mathematics.
