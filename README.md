# Syllabus
###### for IB DP CS with S. Wegscheid

If you are enrolled in this course, you are probably already pretty well aware of what I teach, and the style my courses typically take. This will be a somewhat new adventure though, as I've never had a test in Tech to prep students for. As such, there may be chunks that have to run differently, and you will have to do some stuff outside of class. Majority of my Design and Tech courses at WAIS are designed with regards to IB MYP and CP. Courses also fulfill Texas STEM or Business & Industry graduation endorsements if part of a coherent sequence.

As we move through the year, there are topics we must cover, an additional topic selected between 4 options, cover a programming language, and design a program for a client, documenting and recording how it operates. We will work with Javascript and cover the additional topic of modeling and simulation. One of the options to cover is the web. You can study this more on your own, or use an elective slot (if you still have one) to take web design which will cover all the needed material for this option (and more), and work with the same languages. On the IB exams themselves, you only get to choose one option, but this would give you knowledge in two of the options, and allow you to decide which you think you'd do better on.

Not all classes are available every year. The courses taught are based on the interest level shown on course selection sheets. There are some years where Web Design doesn't make. If you intend to take it next year, you may want to convince friends and other people to take it to to ensure there's enough.

### Classroom Expectations:
The Balcony Mac Lab is a district computer lab, and as such has some policies that are set by the district.

By the district, food and drink are not allowed. This includes candy and gum. Students may have a water bottle, but it needs to be resealable, and kept on the floor.

Every student is sitting at a new iMac with 16 gb of ram and a 21.5” screen. As such, students do not need and should not be using any additional devices without permission. This includes but is not limited to phones, tablets, and chrome books.

In most my courses, specific homework is rarely given. This class has specific content we must cover from IB though, so we'll see how exactly that plays out. I am assuming we will have to have regular homework to move through and practice the content for retention of the important aspects.

### For class, please consider bringing:
* Headphones (your personal use)
* Jacket/Sweater (if you get cold easy)

Please consider bringing some form of supplies for general class use, such as:
* Kleenex
* Graph Paper
* Printer Paper

### Course Content:
Students will work with professional software and languages in design and tech courses. The specific software will vary depending on the course.

When turning in work, use font in a responsible readable manner; around sizes 10-12, good contrast in colors, respectable serif or san serif fonts like Avenir, Helvetica, Georgia, Palatino, Times, etc. Any work in Comic Sans, Papyrus, Curlz, or other overly decorative fonts will not be scored. A document should not have more than 2 or 3 fonts. If variety is needed, make use weight, sizes, and styles within the same font instead of hopping from font to font.

### Major Reports and Projects:
Courses will have documentation accompanying long term project work. These projects and documents are due at the end of each semester, and students will work on different parts of them throughout the course.

This is aligned and modeled from industry and is aligned with IB Design expectations.

### Grading:
Design and Tech places a higher grade percentages on what you do everyday, as opposed to on just a single day when you might have a test or project due.

| %                 | Category                            | 
| ------------------| ----------------------------------- |
| 50%               | * Daily / Activities                |
| 30%               | * Projects / Tests                  |
| 20%               | * Homework / Quizzes / Out of Class |

If there is a question regarding grades in any of your classes, please speak to your teacher sooner than later. There are limitations to when changes can be made. If a grade should be changed, and it isn't because you chose not to talk to me about it, it won't be changed.

### Cheating & Academic Dishonesty
##### Copyright & Intellectual Property:
All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. When it comes to art, many students struggle with understanding intellectual property. As such, it is generally recommended to avoid using copyrighted materials without first discussing it with your instructor.
 
Many students are under the belief that if it is for education, copyright and intellectual property laws don't apply. This is not the case. Many companies choose not to file charges when copyright or intellectual property laws are violated for educational use; some companies do, and this doesn't mean they can't choose to at a later point in time. Use of others' works within your own work, without proper documentation can result in loss of credit. However, use of copyrighted material can also result in legal issues in addition to any academic woes.

##### Collaboration vs Collusion:
All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. The form of academic dishonesty that seems to confuse students is collusion. Collusion is providing or receiving unauthorized aid or assistance. What is or isn't authorized can vary from course to course, so it is important that you communicate with, and understand the expectations of, your instructor.
 
Research, as well as personal experience, shows that students tend to understand content better when working with and discussing content with other students. Some assignments will actually require it. However, it is important that the aid and assistance you receive, or that you provide, is authorized. If you are physically touching another student's keyboard, mouse, or sending complete or partial chunks of an assignment, you are likely engaging in collusion, not collaboration. If unsure, it's better to ask. Collusion is a form of academic dishonesty and can result in loss of credit for all parties involved.

###### Course: §126.33

## Computer Science 1

TechApps in Texas has six main strands based on the National Education Technology Standards and performance indicators based on the International Society for Technology in Education;  creativity and innovation; communication and collaboration; research and information fluency; critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making; digital citizenship; and technology operations and concepts. These are found across the different Tech Apps courses in Texas, including Computer Science.

Computer Science I will foster students' creativity and innovation by presenting opportunities to design, implement, and present meaningful programs through a variety of media. Students will collaborate with one another, their instructor, and various electronic communities to solve the problems presented throughout the course. Through data analysis, students will identify task requirements, plan search strategies, and use computer science concepts to access, analyze, and evaluate information needed to solve problems. By using computer science knowledge and skills that support the work of individuals and groups in solving problems, students will select the technology appropriate for the task, synthesize knowledge, create solutions, and evaluate the results. Students will learn digital citizenship by researching current laws and regulations and by practicing integrity and respect. Students will gain an understanding of the principles of computer science through the study of technology operations, systems, and concepts.
 
#### Course Summary

Don't just learn about computers, learn about how they work, how they think, and how to make them do what you want. We'll create a variety programs throughout the year, and you'll have to apply CS concepts to plan and create a couple of your own.
 
Do not expect Computer Science to be an easy course. While the content is not technically difficult, is does require thinking and solving problems in a way different from majority of courses in the American education system. The content in this course will build on itself. If you don't intend to remember the concepts and basic code throughout the year, you will struggle as future content will make use of previously used content to reinforce and increase the complexity of what you can create. For the course, we use Python with plain text editors, the IDE PyCharm by JetBrains, and documentation and version control with GitHub.

#### As an IB Continuum School

As an IB Continuum School, how we meet the expectations required by the state of Texas may look differently than what you'd see at other schools. The expectations set by Texas rarely match the significantly greater expectations of planning and evaluating found in IB. As such, many educational institutions in Texas expect very little planning and evaluation in their students work, instead often focusing on being able to recall a large amount of content. The International Baccalaureate has a greater focus on planning and evaluating, as well as on application of content instead of recall- especially in the design courses. This is less of an issue in Tech Apps content in Texas, as the newer redefined expectations released in 2012 due reflect greater planning than previous expectations. To what extent and level of focus schools apply to this specific subset of standards will vary, and will mostly likely be less at non-IB campuses.
 
Due to the structure IB expects, our courses tend 'cover' less content, instead choosing to focus on deeper more meaningful interaction between students and content. In the long run, students are better prepared for higher level work, instruction, and the real world. They tend to retain more as well, as they usually actually remember the content due to the significantly deeper understanding of use of content, instead of shallow memorization.
 
#### Lab Hours

Lab hours available for extra time or additional help. If you need guidance, please schedule an appointment. If you just need extra work time, pop-ins are allowed. If you choose not to work in class and are a distraction to others, and then ask to come in for extra time, you will likely be denied extra time. You should make use of the time you already have in scheduled class before requesting more.

Before School: Tuesday - Thursday
* 7:15 - 7:45 am

Lunch: A Days Only
* 12:55 - 1:30 pm

After School: Monday, Tuesday, & Thursday
* 3:15 - 4:00 pm

If you need other accommodations, please see your instructor to make an appointment.

#### Computer Science Course Content
 
Our Computer Science course is designed to be an introduction into the ideas and fundamentals of programming for students with limited to no background in programming. That being said, students are expected to have previous knowledge of computers in general, and should be able to utilize basic everyday software and operating systems. No background in specialized software is required.
 
All students will learn how to create multiple programs by the end of the course. Students will have to plan and design their own programs, both independently and in working with others. The concepts of computer science and programming are embedded into the creation of various programs, there is an increased focus on planning, researching, and creating products in comparison to other Computer Science programs.

Our Computer Science course spans across 2 semesters. The course is broken up into 2 massive units.

**Fall Unit: Classical Encryption**
* What is Programming?
* Basic Programming in Python
* Origins of Programming
* Basic Encryption Techniques
* Design and Program a Rough Encryption Method

**Spring Unit: Text-based Games**
* History of Video Games
* Game Loops & Algorithm-planning
* Object Oriented Programming
* Design your own Text-based Game

For the traditional American education system, this is an elective. An elective does not mean you get a free A. An elective actually means you don't have to pass. You can excel in, barely pass, or fail this class. Which ever result you choose to pursue will be on your transcript, will affect your GPA, and will be included in what is sent to colleges and universities.
 
To IB, this subject area is just as important as any other, and should require rigorous and significant course work. You are expected to put forth a valiant effort consistently during class and throughout the year. The grade is a reflection of your choices; good or bad.

##### A bit of reading material:
-[Why study Computer Science?](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/why-study-computer-science/)

-[6 Surprising Ways Computer Science Benefits Society](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/ways-computer-science-benefits-society/)

##### Concerns?
 
The bare minimum for passing in this region is a 70. If you are not doing the minimum of what is expected, you will most likely score below that. If you are just doing the minimum, your grade will likely fall around there. To excel, you should be creating work above the minimum expectations. If you are interested in programming, but are concerned about jumping into Computer Science 1, It's ok! The whole point of this course is to learn how to program. You aren't expected to already know how to program- where would you learn how if CS1 already expected you to know?
 
If you've never worked with code before, you can still do just fine. If you've taken Tech/Design courses already at WAIS, you've probably already worked with at least a little bit of code. Most of our Tech/Design courses have a couple assignments utilizing code to get you a little more comfortable with it.
 
If you're really concerned about working with code; consider looking into Fundamentals of CompSci and/or Digital Communications before taking Computer Science 1. We might not use the same languages, but you'll still learn how to create with code and be more comfortable in text-based environments.
 
#### Style of Instruction:
Majority of content will be delivered through video instruction. This allows you to revisit content as often as you need, as well as to be able to slow down, speed up, or repeat content as often as you need. This also allows your instructor to work with and help students or groups of students when they need, without stopping the content for the rest of students.
 
As you are able to work at your own pace, this can sometimes cause a general slowdown for some students. Despite being able to watch videos whenever you need, it is important that you keep up with the pace of the course to not end up with a ton of backwork to complete at the midterm or at term's end.
